# Laravel Clerk Guard

## Introduction

This package offers an authentication guard to seamlessly integrate [Clerk](https://clerk.com) authentication into your
Laravel project.

## Installation

1. Use Composer to install the package:

```sh
composer require ronasit/laravel-clerk
```

2. Publish the package configuration:
```sh
php artisan vendor:publish --provider=RonasIT\\Clerk\\ClerkServiceProvider`
```

3. Add a new `clerk` guard within the `guards` array in your `config/auth.php` file:

```php
return [
    'defaults' => [
        'guard' => 'clerk',
        'passwords' => 'users',
    ],

    'guards' => [
        'clerk' => [
            'driver' => 'clerk_session',
            'provider' => 'users',
        ],
        // Other guards...
    ],
```

4. Populate the necessary configuration options in `config/clerk.php`.

## Usage

By default, your app returns the User class with just the external_id property, which holds the user's ID in Clerk.

To customize this behavior, you'll need to create your own UserRepository that implements the UserRepositoryContract.
Then, rebind it in one of the service providers:

```php
use RonasIT\Clerk\Contracts\ClerkUserRepositoryContract;
use App\Support\Clerk\MyAwesomeUserRepository;

class AppServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register(): void
    {
        $this->app->bind(ClerkUserRepositoryContract::class, MyAwesomeUserRepository::class);
    }
}
```
